# Lung-Cancer-Web-App

# Project Overview
This marks the 3rd project within my portfolio. This web app showcases three main aspects of Data science i.e.
- Data Analytics : The dashboard was created using Tableau and is available on the public forum for intreactive visualisation. The data was generated 
- Machine learning (Classification) : The preliminary_test tab in the webapp presents a form which predicts whether there is a probability of having lung cancer using ML model running in the backend. As the dataset is very small consisting of 1000 records and there is huge imbalance. Over Sampling method was implemented.
- Deep learning (image classification) : The CT-scan tab of the webapp presents the image classification using transfer learning method such as Resnet50. And you can test the model by uploading the image to see the inference given by the model.
